UNO-Like Card Game Instructions

OBJECTIVE:
Be the first player to get rid of all your cards or have the fewest cards when the deck runs out.

SETUP:
1. 2-4 players can play (human or AI)
2. Each player starts with 7 cards
3. The remaining cards form the draw pile
4. The top card of the draw pile starts the discard pile

BASIC GAMEPLAY:
1. On your turn, play a card that matches either:
   The COLOR of the top discard pile card, OR
   The NUMBER of the top discard pile card, OR
   Any SPECIAL card (AND, OR, NOT, REVERSE)
2. If you can't play a card, you must draw one card
3. The game ends when one player has no cards left or the draw pile is empty

SPECIAL CARDS:

AND Card:
Played on top of another card, singularly. For Example: if top of pile is Red 5 and you play AND, next player needs Red 5
Next player must play a card matching BOTH the COLOR and NUMBER
If they can't, they draw 4 cards
Example: You play AND with Red 5 → Next player must play Red 5

OR Card:
Played on top of another card, singularly
Next player must play a card matching EITHER the COLOR or NUMBER
If they can't, they draw 4 cards
Example: You play OR with Blue 3 → Next player can play any Blue card or any 3

NOT Card (Skip):
Played by itself
Next player's turn is skipped
In 2-player game, you get another turn

REVERSE Card:
Changes direction of play
In 2-player game, acts like a NOT card (you go again)

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:

1. When you see "color() and number(N)" in messages:
This refers to the NOT card (N) and means the color is irrelevant
NOT cards don't affect colors, they just skip turns

2. AND/OR cards can be played with any card
as mentioned in number 1, an example of this is like when you play an OR 
on a NOT card you will see player___ has to match with color() or number(N),
if they don't they draw 4

3. Color inheritance:
Special cards inherit the color of the card they're played on
After playing a special card, the current color remains what it was before

4. When the deck runs out:
The player with the fewest cards wins, not necessarily who played last

TIPS:
Pay attention to the current color shown in parentheses, usually will be abbreviated, but will be easy to assume
Plan ahead when holding special cards
Watch other players' reactions to guess what cards they might have
